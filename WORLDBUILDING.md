# Version 2

Here’s a connected map of the rooms with expanded descriptions that include how they are connected and detailed interactions for doors, ladders, etc.

---

## 1. Cryosleep Chamber

The metallic chamber is dimly lit, with frost covering the glass of several cryopods. Some are occupied, others flicker with an eerie red light. A control panel by the wall is flashing, signalling a malfunction. An airlock door to the south hums quietly, waiting to be opened.

Items: Plasma Grenade, Armoury Access Card
Objects: Weapons Locker (can be opened), Force Field Control (can be used), Bulkhead Door (west, can be opened)
Exits: West to Abandoned Research Lab


## 4. Observation Deck

The stars swirl outside the enormous viewing window, casting long shadows across the deck. A worn captain’s chair sits in the centre, facing a small console. The floor is littered with personal effects—someone left in a hurry. There's an elevator door to the north and an air vent overhead. A hatch on the floor leads down to the Research Lab.

Items: Captain’s Log, Small Key
Objects: Console (can be used), Elevator (north, requires key), Air Vent (up, can be opened), Hatch (down, can be opened)

## 5. Cargo Bay

Stacks of crates and containers tower over you. The echo of dripping water reverberates from somewhere nearby. A large blast door stands to the west, but it appears locked. A control station sits unattended, its screen flashing warnings about depressurisation. A small corridor to the south leads back to the Maintenance Shaft.

Items: Crowbar, Oxygen Mask
Objects: Crate (can be opened), Blast Door (west, can be opened with crowbar), Control Station (can be used), Corridor (south, can be entered)
Exits: South to Maintenance Shaft


## 6. Maintenance Shaft

A narrow, claustrophobic corridor, lined with rusting pipes and flickering lights. The air smells of oil and ozone. A ladder runs up to a hatch in the ceiling, leading to the engineering deck above. Below, you can see a dark pit descending deeper into the ship. A corridor to the north leads to the Cargo Bay.

Items: Wrench, Flashlight
Objects: Hatch (up, can be opened), Ladder (can be used), Corridor (north, can be entered)
Exits: North to Cargo Bay, Up to Engine Room


## 7. Engine Room

This room hums with the energy of the ship's power core. The huge engine turbines spin slowly, sending vibrations through the metal floor. A fuse box in the corner has been tampered with, its wires exposed. A large ventilation shaft runs to the north, and a door to the east is sealed shut. Below you is the Maintenance Shaft.

Items: Spare Fuse, Insulation Gloves
Objects: Fuse Box (can be used), Ventilation Shaft (north, can be opened), Sealed Door (east, requires repair), Ladder (down, can be used)
Exits: Down to Maintenance Shaft, North to Hydroponics Bay


## 8. Hydroponics Bay

The air is humid, and the green glow of alien plant life fills the room. Broken irrigation systems leak water onto the floor, and several planters have toppled over. A nutrient control panel is blinking, possibly malfunctioning. A sealed door to the south is labelled "Restricted." A large ventilation shaft leads south to the Engine Room.

Items: Plant Sample, Irrigation Key
Objects: Planter (can be moved), Control Panel (can be used), Sealed Door (south, requires repair), Ventilation Shaft (south, can be entered)
Exits: South to Engine Room


## 9. Medical Bay

A sterile room lined with medical supplies. The overhead lights flicker intermittently. Several medpods line the wall, one of them partially open, revealing bloodstains. A medical cabinet stands locked to the east, while a ventilation shaft hums from the ceiling. A ladder leads downwards to the Waste Disposal Chute.

Items: First Aid Kit, Medpod Access Card
Objects: Medpod (can be opened), Medical Cabinet (requires key), Ventilation Shaft (can be entered), Ladder (down, can be used)
Exits: Down to Waste Disposal Chute


## 10. Waste Disposal Chute

The air smells foul, and the sound of machinery grinding away fills the space. You stand on a platform above a deep pit, where robotic arms sort through refuse. A rusty hatch is bolted shut to the south, and a broken console lies to the west. A ladder leads upwards back to the Medical Bay.

Items: Rusty Key, Circuit Board
Objects: Hatch (south, can be opened with key), Broken Console (can be repaired), Ladder (up, can be used)
Exits: Up to Medical Bay, South to Quarantine Zone


## 11. Quarantine Zone

Red warning lights flash across the walls. This room is sealed off by thick, transparent barriers. A terminal displays an ongoing decontamination process. The only way out appears to be a secured airlock to the north, and an emergency release switch next to it. A rusty hatch to the north leads to the Waste Disposal Chute.

Items: Biohazard Suit, Decontamination Key
Objects: Terminal (can be used), Airlock (north, requires key), Rusty Hatch (north, can be opened)
Exits: North to Waste Disposal Chute


## 12. Navigation Bridge

A sleek command centre filled with monitors showing star charts and ship diagnostics. The captain’s chair sits in the centre, facing a large viewport showing the swirling expanse of space. A locked drawer is built into the navigation console. There is a door to the west, and a hatch above you.

Items: Map Module, Drawer Key
Objects: Console (can be used), Locked Drawer (requires key), Door (west, can be opened)
Exits: West to Artificial Gravity Control Room


## 13. Artificial Gravity Control Room

A dull hum fills the air as the artificial gravity generator spins beneath the grated floor. Control panels line the walls, with one flashing warning lights indicating system instability. A service ladder leads up to the deck above, and a reinforced hatch to the east looks sealed.

Items: Gravity Override Chip, Toolkit
Objects: Control Panel (can be used), Reinforced Hatch (east, requires chip), Service Ladder (up, can be used)
Exits: East to Navigation Bridge


## 14. Armoured Corridor

The walls are thick with plating, and the floor vibrates softly beneath your feet. Security cameras swivel as you move, tracking your every step. The door to the west is locked, a glowing panel next to it indicating a security code is required. A small vent grille hangs loose to the north.

Items: Security Code Note, EMP Device
Objects: Security Door (west, requires code), Vent Grille (north, can be opened)
Exits: West to Abandoned Habitation Pod


## 15. Abandoned Habitation Pod

Dust covers everything, and the air is stale. Personal belongings are scattered on the floor, and the lights flicker weakly. A terminal sits powered down on a desk. There’s a closed storage locker to the north, and a service door to the east is ajar.

Items: Power Cell, Holotape
Objects: Storage Locker (can be opened), Terminal (can be used)
Exits: East to Armoured Corridor
