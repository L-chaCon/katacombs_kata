Here are a variety of location titles and descriptions for your sci-fi text adventure game. Each location is crafted with interactive objects, items, and points of interest to fit the gameplay mechanics:

## 1. Cryosleep Chamber

The metallic chamber is dimly lit, with frost covering the glass of several cryopods. Some are occupied, others flicker with an eerie red light. A control panel by the wall is flashing, signalling a malfunction. An airlock door to the south hums quietly, waiting to be opened.

Items: Cryopod Keycard, Emergency Toolkit
Objects: Cryopod (can be opened), Control Panel (can be used)


## 2. Abandoned Research Lab

Shattered glass tubes and overturned workstations suggest something went wrong here. A strange humming sound emits from a broken containment unit in the corner. A data pad lies on a table, its screen cracked but still operational. You can see a hatch leading upwards through the ceiling, and a bulkhead door to the east.

Items: Data Pad, Access Chip
Objects: Containment Unit (can be opened), Bulkhead Door (requires chip)


## 3. Maintenance Shaft

A narrow, claustrophobic corridor, lined with rusting pipes and flickering lights. The air smells of oil and ozone. A ladder runs up to a hatch in the ceiling, leading to the engineering deck above. Below, you can see a dark pit descending deeper into the ship.

Items: Wrench, Flashlight
Objects: Hatch (can be opened), Ladder (can be used)


## 4. Armoury Vault

Heavy metal walls encase this vault, stocked with various weapons behind a transparent force field. The vault control console blinks with a red security lock. A weapons locker stands in the corner, locked with a manual switch. To the west is a heavily fortified door.

Items: Plasma Grenade, Armoury Access Card
Objects: Weapons Locker (can be opened), Force Field Control (can be used)


## 5. Observation Deck

The stars swirl outside the enormous viewing window, casting long shadows across the deck. A worn captain’s chair sits in the centre, facing a small console. The floor is littered with personal effects—someone left in a hurry. There's an elevator door to the north and an air vent overhead.

Items: Crowbar, Oxygen Mask
Objects: Crate (can be opened), Blast Door (can be opened with crowbar)


## 7. Engine Room

This room hums with the energy of the ship's power core. The huge engine turbines spin slowly, sending vibrations through the metal floor. A fuse box in the corner has been tampered with, its wires exposed. A large ventilation shaft runs to the north, and a door to the east is sealed shut.

Items: Spare Fuse, Insulation Gloves
Objects: Fuse Box (can be used), Ventilation Shaft (can be opened)


## 8. Hydroponics Bay

The air is humid, and the green glow of alien plant life fills the room. Broken irrigation systems leak water onto the floor, and several planters have toppled over. A nutrient control panel is blinking, possibly malfunctioning. A sealed door to the south is labelled "Restricted."

Items: Plant Sample, Irrigation Key
Objects: Planter (can be moved), Control Panel (can be used)


## 9. Medical Bay

A sterile room lined with medical supplies. The overhead lights flicker intermittently. Several medpods line the wall, one of them partially open, revealing bloodstains. A medical cabinet stands locked to the east, while a ventilation shaft hums from the ceiling.

Items: First Aid Kit, Medpod Access Card
Objects: Medpod (can be opened), Medical Cabinet (requires key)


## 10. Waste Disposal Chute

The air smells foul, and the sound of machinery grinding away fills the space. You stand on a platform above a deep pit, where robotic arms sort through refuse. A rusty hatch is bolted shut to the south, and a broken console lies to the west.

Items: Rusty Key, Circuit Board
Objects: Hatch (can be opened with key), Broken Console (can be repaired)


## 11. Quarantine Zone

Red warning lights flash across the walls. This room is sealed off by thick, transparent barriers. A terminal displays an ongoing decontamination process. The only way out appears to be a secured airlock to the north, and an emergency release switch next to it.

Items: Biohazard Suit, Decontamination Key
Objects: Terminal (can be used), Airlock (requires key)


## 12. Navigation Bridge

A sleek command centre filled with monitors showing star charts and ship diagnostics. The captain’s chair sits in the centre, facing a large viewport showing the swirling expanse of space. A locked drawer is built into the navigation console. There is a door to the west, and a hatch above you.

Items: Map Module, Drawer Key
Objects: Console (can be used), Locked Drawer (requires key)


## 13. Artificial Gravity Control Room

A dull hum fills the air as the artificial gravity generator spins beneath the grated floor. Control panels line the walls, with one flashing warning lights indicating system instability. A service ladder leads up to the deck above, and a reinforced hatch to the east looks sealed.

Items: Gravity Override Chip, Toolkit
Objects: Control Panel (can be used), Hatch (requires chip)


## 14. Armoured Corridor

The walls are thick with plating, and the floor vibrates softly beneath your feet. Security cameras swivel as you move, tracking your every step. The door to the west is locked, a glowing panel next to it indicating a security code is required. A small vent grille hangs loose to the north.

Items: Security Code Note, EMP Device
Objects: Security Door (requires code), Vent Grille (can be opened)


## 15. Abandoned Habitation Pod

Dust covers everything, and the air is stale. Personal belongings are scattered on the floor, and the lights flicker weakly. A terminal sits powered down on a desk. There’s a closed storage locker to the north, and a service door to the east is ajar.
